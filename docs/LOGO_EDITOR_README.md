# NHL LED Scoreboard Logo Editor

A web-based WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for positioning, sizing, and rotating team logos for the `nhl-led-scoreboard`. This tool allows you to visually tweak logo layouts for different matrix resolutions (64x32, 128x32 or 128x64) without manually editing JSON coordinates.

## Features

* **Visual Interface**: Drag-and-drop positioning relative to the specific matrix size.
* **Live Preview**: View the actual scoreboard emulator running in real-time below the editor. You can also select to simulate past games.
* **Multi-Resolution Support**: Switch between 64x32, 128x64, and 128x32 layouts seamlessly.
* **Asset Management**: Automatically downloads and converts high-quality logos from the NHL API if local assets are missing.
* **Alt Logo Support**: Easily upload and manage alternate logos for any team. Upload local files or fetch images via URL (supports PNG and SVG)
* **Emulator Control**: Launch, stop, and toggle the emulator window directly from the web browser.
* **Smart Configuration**: Automatically manages default values and maintains a rolling history of the last 5 configuration backups.
* **Team Colors**: Customize team primary and text colors directly from the UI, with changes persisted to `teams.json`.

## Prerequisites

Before running the editor, ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. It is recommended to install these in your scoreboard's virtual environment.  

>[!note]
> These requirements are already installed as part of main installation.

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment first
source ~/nhlsb-venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install flask pillow cairosvg
```

*(Note: `cairosvg` is required for auto-downloading and converting missing vector logos).*

---

## Installation

1. Place `logo_editor.py` in the root directory of your `nhl-led-scoreboard` installation (same level as `main.py`).
2. Create a folder named `templates` in the root directory.
3. Place `editor.html` inside the `templates` folder.

## Usage

### Starting the Editor

Run the script using Python. By default, it will detect your virtual environment and scoreboard location.

```bash
python3 logo_editor.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to: <http://localhost:5000>

### Command Line Arguments

If you have a custom setup, you can specify paths using arguments:

| Argument | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--port` | The port to run the web editor on. | `5000` |
| `--host` | Address to listen on. Use `127.0.0.1` to allow only the device itself (e.g. behind a reverse proxy). | `0.0.0.0` (whole local network) |
| `--set-password` | Set or reset the dashboard password, then exit. See [Signing in](#signing-in). | |
| `--debug` | Flask debug mode. **Development only**: it lets anyone who can reach the port run code on the device. | off |
| `--dir` | The root directory of the scoreboard installation. | Current Directory |
| `--venv` | Path to your python virtual environment. | Auto-detects active env, or defaults to `~/nhlsb-venv` |

**Example:**

```bash
python3 logo_editor.py --port 8080 --dir /opt/nhl-led-scoreboard --venv /opt/my_venv
```

## Signing in

The dashboard and editor are protected by a single password.

- **First visit:** you are sent to a setup page to choose a password. Setup is only offered to devices on your local network (home Wi-Fi, or Tailscale), never to the public internet, so do this soon after installing or upgrading. Anything that was calling the dashboard's `/api/...` endpoints without logging in will now get `401`.
- **Afterwards:** every page and API call needs the login. Browsers stay signed in for 30 days. Use **🔑 Password** in the dashboard header to change it (this signs out your other devices) and **Sign out** to end the session.
- **Forgot it?** On the scoreboard (SSH in), run `python3 src/logo_editor.py --set-password` (using the scoreboard's virtualenv). Everyone is signed out and must use the new password.
- Only the salted hash of the password is stored, in `config/dashboard_auth.json` (not committed to git, readable only by its owner).

The login stops other devices on your network, and web pages open in your browser, from changing your scoreboard. It is not encryption: traffic is plain HTTP, so don't expose port 5000 directly to the internet. For remote access use a VPN such as Tailscale.

## Live display

The Status tab shows what is on the LED panel right now, redrawn as round LEDs and refreshed about once a second (turn off **LED look** for a plain scaled image). It is the real frame from the running scoreboard, not a simulation. The scoreboard only prepares these frames while a dashboard page is open, so it costs nothing when nobody is watching. "No signal" means the scoreboard isn't running.

## Interface Guide

### 1. Configuration Panel (Left Sidebar)

* **Matrix Size:** Select the resolution of your board (e.g., 64x32). This resizes the editor grid and automatically loads the corresponding `logos_WxH.json` file.
* **Config File:** Shows the currently loaded JSON file.
* **Team:** Select the team logo you wish to edit. Use the dropdown to select specific teams or their **ALT** variants.
* **Team Colors:** Click the color pickers to adjust the **Primary** and **Text** colors for the selected team. Don't forget to click "Save Colors" to persist changes.
* **Stance:** Select **Home** (Left) or **Away** (Right).
* **Opponent (Visual Only):** Select a second team to render on the opposite side. This helps visualize spacing.
* **Show Gradient Layer:** Toggles the background gradient asset to ensure logos blend correctly.

### 2. Emulator Control

Located in the sidebar, these buttons control the actual `src/main.py` scoreboard script.

* **Launch:** Starts the scoreboard in emulator mode with the currently selected resolution.
* **Open/Collapse:** Toggles the visibility of the emulator iframe.
* **Stop:** Kills the emulator process.

*> **Note:** If you change the Matrix Size in the dropdown while the emulator is running, the tool will ask if you want to restart the emulator to match the new resolution.*

### 3. Visual Editor (Workspace)

The large grid represents your LED Matrix.

* **Move:** Click and drag the logo to position it.
* **Zoom/Resize:**
  * **Scroll Wheel:** Hover over the logo and scroll up/down to zoom.
  * **Shift + Drag:** Hold `Shift`, click the logo, and drag up/down to resize.

* **Reference Lines:** Red anchor dots help align your images.
* **Overlays:** Static renders of game text (Score, Time) help prevent overlaps.

### 4. Adjustments & Saving

* **Numeric Inputs:** Use the X, Y, Zoom, and Rotate inputs for pixel-perfect adjustments.
* **Flip Horizontal:** Useful for logos that face a specific direction.
* **Replace Logo:** Upload a new image to replace the current team's logo.
  * **File Upload:** Select a local PNG or JPG.
  * **URL Upload:** Paste a direct link to an image (supports SVG).
* **Reset:** Reverts the logo to the values from the last save.
* **SAVE CHANGES:** Writes values to the JSON file. **A backup of the previous file is created (last 5 kept).**

## Troubleshooting

**The Emulator iframe says "Connection Refused"**

This happens when the emulator process is starting up or has stopped.

1. Click the **Stop** button.
2. Click **Launch**.
3. Wait for the "Loading..." overlay to disappear.

**My logo isn't showing up**

If a specific resolution PNG is missing, the editor will attempt to download the SVG from the NHL API. Check your terminal for errors.

**The Editor Grid is the wrong size**

Ensure you selected the correct **Matrix Size** from the dropdown.
